NOTE: When I received your comments, I deleted the files from the repository and uploaded them again. That is why the time for uploading is just last week. Actually some of them were uploaded 3 months ago.

In this Practical Machine Learning class, we have delved into the basics of machine learning to hyperparameter optimization to feature importance. The class also required us to do some exercises involving regression and classification problems and exploratory data analysis.
In the projects, I have utilized three datasets; one was used for all the regression and the other was used for all the classification tasks. The last dataset which was used for the project is a property of WYDOT hence I cannot upload it here, neither can I also submit it to
anyone without their permission.

The descriptions of the datasets are as follows:

Dataset for Regression Tasks:
The data used is from a machine learning tutorial I did on Udemy, the data consists of five variables. Four of the variables are numeric and one of the variables is categorical. The dependent variable is the “Profit”. The data is trying to predict the profit made by startups 
based on their expenditure in the following area: “Research & Development”, “Administration”, and “Marketing”. Regarding missing values, the data does not include any missing values.

Dataset for Classification Tasks:
The data consists of nine independent variables. All the variables are numeric. The dependent variable is the “Class”. The data is trying to predict the whether the plant will grow “big or tall” or otherwise considering the characteristics of the plant. 
Class “2” means the plant will grow “big or tall” and Class “4” means “Otherwise”.

Dataset for WildCard Project:
This project used 11 years (2010 – 2021) of historical crash data in Utah. The crash level database contained crash information such as crash location, weather and roadway conditions, first harmful event (FHE), FHE location, etc. 
The vehicle level database contained information related to each vehicle such as vehicle contributing circumstances, etc. The person-level database contained information about each person involved in the crash, such as the sex of the driver, age, etc. 
The crash injury severity levels reported are grouped into five (5) categories; fatal injury (K), suspected serious injury (A), suspected minor injury (B), possible injury (C), and no injury/property damage only (O). 
For this project, the crash injury severity levels were grouped into binary (1 or 0) response variables. Fatal (K) and suspected serious injuries (A) were represented as 1 – Fatal Injury (KA). All other crash injury severity levels were also aggregated into 
a single category - Non-Fatal Injury (BCO).
